<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal of this is to put together the proposal for a project that you will do in class.  If you are an MS or PhD student, then this project should ideally be part of your research, and be useful for you outside of this class.  If you are an MEng student, then you should try to propose a project that either automates something that you did as part of your undergraduate career, or does something that you're interested in.  For example, if you like baseball, maybe it could scrape a baseball score web site and email you the results every day.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>We're looking for a one-page project proposal, with the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Background</strong>.  What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important to you.  Don't assume that the reader knows anything about the problem you're describing; avoid jargon when you can, and write for a general audience.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Current Approach</strong>.  What are you doing now to solve this problem.  Why is this not a good solution.  If you're not solving the problem at all right now, explain why you want to solve it.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Proposed Work</strong>.  What are you going to do, at a functional level?  For example: I am going to scrape the historical temperature information for Corvallis from [some web site], graph these data, calculate when it's colder here than in Denver, and then send a text message to my mother on those days.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluation</strong>.  How will you show that your code works and does the right thing?  How are you going to test your code?<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deliverables and Grading</strong>.  What are you going to produce?  Describe the code and what it will do.  Generate a grading rubric, assuming that we give you 100 points in total.  Be as specific as possible: if you write: "code works: 100 points" and the code does not work (for any reason), you get 0 points.  Structure your project with two milestones, and one final deliverable.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you want to bounce some ideas off me, let me know.  I'm happy to chat about potential projects.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The project should be moderately tricky and, ideally, useful.  It should solve some real problem that you care about.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The project is worth about 20% of your grade.  That's about as much as a homework.  Look at homework 1, and try to make your project at least that involved.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
<p>A one-page pdf file of your proposal.  Don't use a font smaller than 11pt, and keep your margins at least 1in.  If you don't do this, we'll subtract 10%, ask you do redo it, and recurse.</p>
