<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p><span>The main purpose of this lab is to give you some experience navigating the Linux operating system and command-line tools, the Python programming environment, and to write your very first Python program. Even if you have experience with some of these things already, you should make sure you complete this lab, since from now on, we're going to assume that you know all of this background stuff.</span></p>
<h1>Assignment</h1>
<ol>
<li>Install the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment, following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OJXYNF6raOj6UUo1hyhbjN5eF5p2okef1LTjkBVq1HA/edit#heading=h.ngtnnvn88iua">these instructions.</a>
</li>
<li>Start up PyCharm, and write the following basic Python program.<br><br><code>#!/usr/bin/env python<br><br>print 'Hello, World!'</code><br><br>Once you've typed it in, verify that you can run it.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Write some python code that calculates the volume of a cylinder of height 5 and radius 3.  Put this in a file called<span> </span><code>cylinder.py</code><span> </span>that prints out the answer when you run it.  Verify that you're printing out the right value.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write some python code that calcuates the volume of a torus with an inner radius (the radius of the hole) of 3 and an outer radius (the radius from the center of the shape to the outer edge of the shape) of 4, and prints it out.  Put this code in a file called<span> </span><code>torus.py</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><span>Grading</span></h1>
<p><span>You will be graded for showing the TA the following things.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Running your Hello, World! code from PyCharm.  1 point each for running the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running the code for the cylinder volume calculation.  1 point for code that runs.  1 point for getting the correct answer. [2 points total]</p>
</li>
<li><span>Running the code for the torus volume calculation.  1 point for code that runs.  1 point for getting the correct answer. [2 points total]</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span>What to Hand In</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing for this lab.  This homework is due in the first lab session on Tuesday.  Show the TA your working code to get your points.</p>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ol>
<li>Just to be very clear, you should write code that calculates the value for the last two questions, not code that simply prints out a number you have previously typed in. Yes, someone tries this in<span> </span><em>every</em><span> </span>introductory class like this.<br><br>
</li>
<li>No, we didn't tell you how to calculate the volumes of the cylinder or the torus.  Yes, this was on purpose.  Yes, the information is probably available on the Internet somewhere, in case you don't have it at your fingertips.  Yes, it's possible to search for it.  Yes, this will be recurring theme in the class.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Rules</h1>
<p>Everything you do for this lab should be your own work. Don't look up the answers on the web, or copy them from any other source. You can look up general information about Python on the web, but no copying code you find there. Read the code, close the browser, then write your own code.</p>
